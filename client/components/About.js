              On June 3, 2012, Solly DeLaurentis, Jr. tragically lost his life
              from a rare undetected heart defect that caused him to black
              out while on a motorcycle run benefiting Salvation Army charities.
              At which time the lives of his wife and their three children were
              drastically changed and their future was uncertain. The implications
              of losing a parent at a young age, both emotionally and financially,
              are one of life’s most difficult ordeals.

              "I have learned so many things this year about myself, my children,
              my endearing family, and ever so caring friends. It’s clear to me now
              how kind and generous people are. People care and want to make a
              difference. This is where the idea of the Solly’s Way Foundation
              came about." - Sharyn DeLaurentis

                      Solly's Way Foundation brings compassion to tragedy, and turns
                      tragedy to triumph, by providing college scholarships to students
                      who have lost a parent or guardian. The sudden loss of a parental
                      figure triggers a braod range of family crises that may take
                      years to surmount. It is with our best efforts and dedication
                      to present these young adults with a greater chance for a
                      successful future.
